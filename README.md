textize
=======

Textize is a web-based transcript writing system for audio and video files.

To start, open `index.html`. You'd need to know the following while writing transcripts:

 - `Start Time` and `End Time` buttons enable/disable insertion of start and end times respectively. However, they can only be turned on/off before writing the transcript.
 - There are many keyboard shortcuts you can use:
     + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>SPACE</kbd>: Pause/Play media
     + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>: Insert start/end time. End time is inserted automatically at the correct position irrespective of the current cursor position.
     + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>: Insert heading. Headings enable you to click on them to skip to the appropriate time in the media.
     + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>: Undo. Do NOT use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> to undo the previous operation. 
         
        It can be fixed but in the current version please refrain from using the latter key combination.

     + <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>: Preview
